title: "PyTsetlin: A Low-Code Pythonic Implementation of Coalesced Tsetlin Machine"
abstract: "A low-code, feature-POOR, Pythonic implementation of a Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. This is not intended to be a feature-rich or speed-optimized implementation, but rather an easy-to-use TM programmed in Python, with the intent of making it accessible to plug-and-play new ideas and be able to get some results, either on an input level or TM memory level."
